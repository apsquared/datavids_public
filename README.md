# DATAVIDS

## Background

DataVids was created as a side project to help promote my other two sites [BarGPT, AI Cocktail Creator](https://www.bargpt.app) and [TVFoodMaps](https://www.tvfoodmaps.com) promote their content on TikTok.  After finding the awesome [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) project I decided to try and build
a full SaaS video creation site.  

## What Happened

After building the site it became clear that keeping up with the many projects in this area would take more effort than I was willing to put in and I didn't want to offer a product that was inferior to people.  Also at the same time I came to the realization that projects like BarGPT and TVFoodMaps are more my speed.

## So what next?

Instead of the site just being a total waste, I figured I'd make the source open to anyone who wants to learn any of the following:

* Remotion
* NextJS (with app router)
* Stripe Integraion
* Using Lambdas to render videos
* Basic AI for creating videos

There is a lot of great content inside this code.  Look it over, learn from it, steal it.  

## Thanks! How can I help?
